                images=', '.join(data['images']),
                links=', '.join(data['links'])
            )
            session.add(data_to_store)
        session.commit()

    def retrieve_data(self):
        session = self.Session()
        data = session.query(ScrapedData).all()
        return [{
            'url': d.url,
            'text': d.text,
            'images': d.images.split(', '),
            'links': d.links.split(', ')
        } for d in data]

    def generate_word_cloud(self, text):
        wordcloud = WordCloud().generate(text)
        plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
        plt.axis('off')
        plt.show()
```

6. Define the AutonomousWebContentScraperAndAnalyzer class to automate scraping and analysis:

```python
class AutonomousWebContentScraperAndAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, topics, db_name):
        self.topics = topics
        self.db_name = db_name
        self.query_generator = QueryGenerator(self.topics)
        self.web_scraper = WebScraper()
        self.content_analyzer = ContentAnalyzer('bert-base-uncased')
        self.data_storage = DataStorage(self.db_name)

    def scrape_and_analyze(self):
        search_queries = self.query_generator.generate_search_queries()
        urls = self.web_scraper.scrape_urls(search_queries)
        scraped_data = self.web_scraper.scrape_content(urls)
        self.data_storage.store_data(scraped_data)

        data = self.data_storage.retrieve_data()
        texts = [d['text'] for d in data]
        combined_text = ' '.join(texts)
        self.data_storage.generate_word_cloud(combined_text)

        sentiment_scores = []
        summaries = []
        for d in data:
            sentiment = self.content_analyzer.analyze_sentiment(d['text'])
            sentiment_scores.append(sentiment)
            summary = self.content_analyzer.analyze_summary(d['text'])
            summaries.append(summary)

        keywords = self.content_analyzer.analyze_keywords(combined_text)
        entities = self.content_analyzer.analyze_entities(combined_text)

        df = pd.DataFrame({'Sentiment': sentiment_scores, 'Summary': summaries})
        print(df.head())
        print("Keywords:", keywords)
        print("Entities:", entities)
```

7. Customize the `topics` and `db_name` variables to suit your needs:

```python
topics = ['technology', 'business']
db_name = 'web_content'
```

8. Create an instance of the `AutonomousWebContentScraperAndAnalyzer` class and call the `scrape_and_analyze` method:

```python
scraper = AutonomousWebContentScraperAndAnalyzer(topics, db_name)
scraper.scrape_and_analyze()
```

Run the Python script, and the program will autonomously generate search queries, scrape web pages, store the scraped data in a database, perform content analysis, and display the results.
